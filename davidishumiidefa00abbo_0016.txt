x PREFATORY NOTICE.

scriber have unfortunately not been carefully corrected, though
they are rarely of sufficient importance to interfere with the
meaning. In printing, a few words have been introduced be-
tween brackets [ ]‚ where the manuscript has been worn, or
where the transcriber appears to have omitted them, and a

omitted or changed some words, may be elucidated by the fol-
lowing extract :—“ He, too securely trusting to the swiftness of

Huine, of Wedderburn‚ before the Castle of Wark, in page 37,
the following, which is not to be found in the Latin manuscript,
is added by the translatorz—“ After his return, the King, as a

reward for his services and extraordinary behaviour, gave him
