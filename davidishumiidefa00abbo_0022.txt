petit livre surpassa tous les autres, autant que 16 jour surpassa

David Hume, Anna, the gentlewoman alluded to in the letters
of Drummond quoted above, was also an authoress, having pub-
lished at Edinburgh, in 1644, the Triumphs of Petrarch‚ in
English verse. She is said to have translated her father’s Latin

poems into English verse.
